I just changed the default code of App.js where I created the interface for the tic-tac-toe. 
In addition to that, I also changed the codes inside the App.css to style the App.js.
I created a node file named server.js in the root directory. This file is the Node.js backend server code. It handles API endpoints for making moves and resetting the game. It uses the Express.js framework to set up the server.

So far, there are no unhandled cases.

For future improvements, I'd like to add the scores of the player.
